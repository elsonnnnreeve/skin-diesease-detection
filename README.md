# AI-Based Skin Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

This project implements a CNN-based model (EfficientNet) for detecting 7 types of skin diseases.  
The system includes:

- A TensorFlow-based deep learning model  
- A FastAPI backend for prediction  
- A React frontend for users to upload skin images  
- Grad-CAM heatmaps for explainability  
- A simple triage recommendation system
